This blog serves the following purposes:

* Document my studies around different topics so the future me can easily recall what I did, as it is easier to follow one's own thoughts than someone else's, even if someone else is more knowledgeable.

* Help others interested in the same topics learn them. I strive to make my posts logical and self-contained.

The topics of this blog include the following: software engineering, algorithms, information retrieval, machine learning and deep learning.
